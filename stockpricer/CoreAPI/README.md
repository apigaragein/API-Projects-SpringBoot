# Stock Pricer Reference Implementation

This is a reference implementation for an set of API's that will provide stock price analysis details. I am building this API implementation to showcase this to my prospective employers (full time or contract) and to help those who are looking for such an implementation that embodies all best practices, technologies, that make a microservies app. 

Scope for this is only API part and I am not keen in building the front end. 

Stack used in this - Java 11, Spring Boot, MySQL, and related technologies. Intellij Community edition is the IDE. 

There is another repository called API Samples here. Whatever concepts I want to implement in Stock Pricer API, will be first written as a sample to learn that concept and then moved here as a proper implementation. 

I will also try to bring one more repository up where I will post specfic code samples related to Patterns used in this reference implemntation. 

More code, more documentation will be added hence keep watching this space for more updates regularly.
